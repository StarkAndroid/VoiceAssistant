# VoiceAssistant

This is a project, in which I will intend to create a simple VoiceAssistant.

# 1st stage

In the first stage I will use my knowledge about Recurrant Neural Nets (RNN) to create a WakeWord functionality. In order to do that I will:
- gather data - record audio with background noise and with me saying the "WakeWord"
- create and train a RNN that should be able to distinguish between the WakeWord and other sounds

The work in this stage will be based on the project already published by pritishmishra703. The project is available online on https://github.com/pritishmishra703/WakeWordDetection.

If successful, I will proceed to the 2nd stage.

# 2nd stage

The VoiceAssistant is already awoken. Now it will listen and try to interpret my commands. I am planning that it will be able to:
- open my favourite websites in Google Chrome
- play a Spotify playlist
- shut down my PC
- tell the temperature in my hometown
